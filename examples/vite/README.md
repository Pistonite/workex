# Example: Vite

This example shows how to use the library with a modern build tool like Vite.

You should be able to use any package manager/runtime you like. However
note that `bun` has some issues and HMR does not work consistently (there
are some weird issues). I recommend using `node` to run this example.

First install the packages with `npm install`, then
run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
