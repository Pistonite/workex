# Example: Standalone

This example shows how to use the library
with vanilla HTML + JS using TypeScript and a build tool like `bun`

If you use a package manager other than `pnpm`, replace the version of
`@pistonite/workex` in `package.json` with the latest on npmjs.org

First install the packages with `pnpm install`, then,
see `Taskfile.yml` for the commands needed to run the example.
