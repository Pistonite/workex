# Setup

```admonish danger
Version `0.0.6` is a complete rewrite to expand the support from Workers to Windows,
and enhanced the experience of multiple protocols running on the same channel.
```

Workex is a solution to RPC in the JS world. You define interfaces in
TypeScript, and Workex generates code so that calling a remote
context uses the same interface you define.

Workex provides support for these bidirectional RPCs:
- Between `Window` and `Worker`
- Between 2 `Window`s, for both same- and cross-origin
  - For example, the main window and iframes, or popouts
- WebSocket support might be added in the future

The library works as follows:
- You define the messaging protocol as TypeScript interfaces
- Run the `workex` CLI to generate code in your project
- Use the generated code and the `@pistonite/workex` SDK library
  to have seamless RPC - Handshake, protocol agreement, error handling, same- and cross-origin...
  all handled internally

To get started, install the CLI tool with

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/Pistonite/workex
```
After installing, you can run `workex --help` to see the available options.
See the [tutorials](./tutorial/index.md) for a full end-to-end walk-through
of running some basic RPC stuff.

## TypeScript SDK
The code generated by the `workex` CLI depends on the `@pistonite/workex` TypeScript SDK.
You can install it with your favorite package manager. For example, for `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm i @pistonite/workex
```
The [tutorials](./tutorial/index.md) shows basic examples for using the SDK.
You can also refer to the [SDK reference](./reference/index.md) when needed.

Note that:
- The SDK version and workex version should match exactly
- The SDK is TypeScript-only, so a bundler is needed to consume it.
