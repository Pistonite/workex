# SDK Reference

This section is the main documentation of the SDK library. It details
the behavior of the API sets, as well as some designs and underlying concepts
used internally (and externally).

Some of these concepts are:
- [JS Messaging Channel](./messaging.md)
- [An End of a Channel](./channel_end.md)
- [The BUS]()

Also, the generated API reference is available [here](/docs). This can be
used as quick reference and supplement to this documentation.

The SDK reference is organized bottom-up, meaning it starts with the lowest
level of concepts and browser primitives, and then build up to the high level
APIs that you saw in the tutorials.
